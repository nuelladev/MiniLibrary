## Features

- Manage Users: Add, update, and delete library users.
- Manage Books: Add, update, and delete library books.
- Borrow and Return Books: Allow users to borrow and return books.
- Mostly identifies books with ISBN and identifies an ISBN as a unique value. Why? This is beacause each author can write two books and 2 books can have the same name. Hence, it only makes sense to identify unique books added to the system with their ISBN number. And the ISBN numbers can either be a 10 digit number or a thirteen digit number. 
- Activity Logging: Log all library activities to a file by dates.Checkout the screenshot below:
